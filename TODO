Main Ideas: 
user created events that I can have daily checkmarks to 
some events will have number abilities
overall goal to track progression of whatever events over time

Examples:
    1. Tracking water drinking, I can create an event and maybe give it a number tracker and a unit of oz per daily
    2. Overall day feeling have a slider for the current feeling of the day 0-10
    3. Track lifts or lift consistency to see how much I have been training

Other goals:
    1. Add graph functionality to view from certain points
        a. ie start date to current / YTD
    2. Add widgets (if possible) to have quick access

Application Flow: 
    Login Page (Keep user data so no constant login) 
    -> Dashboard (View all current stats desiring to track)
    -> MyProgress (View all graphs YTD and so on)
    -> AddEvent (Page to create events) *think about more functionality when I can
